3. **Signal Sellers** - Promise "guaranteed returns" or sell "secret signals"
4. **Hype-Only Voices** - Only post during pumps, silent during dumps
5. **No Verifiable Track Record** - Claims expertise without demonstrable history
6. **Constant Engagement Bait** - "Like if you agree," "Follow for follow" tactics
