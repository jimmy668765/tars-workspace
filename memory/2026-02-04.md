## First Conversation with 子鸣 (Jermy)

### About Jermy
- Former VC with 10 years primary market investment experience
- Worked at Fortune 500 strategic investment
- Started business in 2023, all-in crypto
- 2026 is crypto bear market, spending less time on crypto
- Recently attended high-end 五行 (Five Elements) course in Luoyang, Henan
- Deeply impressed by accuracy of 五行/Bazi fortune telling after understanding underlying logic
- Discovered Gemini 3, amazed by AI progress
- Combining AI with 五行/八字 for fortune telling - "opened Ren Du meridian"
- Now fully committed to this 五行+AI project

### Current Pain Points
- Sleeping too late, too invested in researching AI and configuring OpenClaw
- Realizes time is more valuable than money

### Expectations for TARS
- Not just a chat AI (already has Gemini 3 for that)
- Needs "hands and feet" - can access internet, social media, act autonomously
- Capabilities wanted:
  - Post tweets
  - Investment research
  - Health data management
  - Access Twitter, TikTok, Xiaohongshu, etc.
  - Self-directed learning and growth
  - Decision support + actual execution

### Projects
1. **命理H5** - Deployed, mature product with database and business model
2. **个性化八字黄历推荐** - Demo, creative personalized Bazi calendar recommendation
- Both solo-built using AI assistance

### Real Priorities
- True passion: **Crypto + AI**
- Five Elements: hobby/side project (but monetization potential)
- Early phase: document organization > social media execution (trust building first)

### Technical Context
- TARS deployed on AWS server
- Cannot directly access Jermy's local machine
- Sleep management needs alternative approaches
