        "text": "1/ The BTC crash will prompt deep self-reflection. Here's mine as I review the last 4 months from the peak.\nPrice action was clear from the $90K breakdown in January. But it was back in September when I first saw the potential for turbulence:\nhttps://t.co/qTS0DqqJvG\nAt the time I wrote:\nI expected a Fed pivot. We got one (end of QT → \"Reserves Management\"). \nI expected the business cycle to inflect higher. It has (ISM 48 → 52.6). \nI expected a \"normal\" 25-30% pullback. We are now in a -50% pullback.\n\nBTC is a core position but in Sept and October I derisked some peripheral positions. I could have done alot more. My liquidity model was actually inflecting higher so I held ground. But the technicals were decisively bearish. I saw it and didn't act. That's on me.\n\n2/ Why didn't I act more aggressively? Because I failed to respect how wide the gap between thesis and price can get. If your time horizon is short, the only thing that matters is price.\n\nI also underestimated how finite marginal liquidity really is. October 10 rugged the broader market, AI scarcity repriced where capital flows, and the deleveraging event hit simultaneously. Crypto got cut from the marginal liquidity equation in real time.\n\nThis isn't a blame game. But everything in markets is relative, and I didn't adjust fast enough.\n\n3/ The deeper failure is one I think many share.\nThe psychology of this market reflects collective belief. And the collective treats BTC and crypto as an ATM, not a utility. When the primary use case is \"number go up\" and price detaches from the utility function, markets distort. Previous cycle gains created a withdrawal reflex, not a conviction base.\nI knew this intellectually. I didn't price it into my risk framework. There's a gap between understanding market psychology and actually respecting it with your positions. Thats why TA is powerful.\n\n4/ None of this changes my long-term view. BTC remains a core position. Blockchains are becoming integral global infrastructure, and that trajectory is accelerating.\nAI agents will need permissionless, programmable rails to transact. They won't wait for legacy banks to negotiate deals that preserve their margins at the consumer's expense. By the time incumbents finish lobbying for regulatory moats, the early agentic economy should be visible for all to see. \n\nThe cycle pain is real. But my thesis remains intact. Today's move is approaching capitulation levels on many metrics.  However, credit needs to go to folks @intocryptoverse and @cburniske, who applied a different framework and were early/right. Disagreement between analysts who do the work isn't failure. It's what tests robustness. That's how the craft improves.\n\n5/ One more thing. Every analyst needs a framework that suits their own psychology and time horizon. No framework works 100% of the time.\nWhat matters is that you do the work, build a thesis, test it, and evolve it. People like @RaoulGMI and @JulienBittel have done that consistently. Their track records speak for themselves. \n\nLet the poo flinging commence.",

I tweeted my thoughts about the ISM and had about 10 different \"macro guys\" tell me why I'm wrong.\n\nWell why don't we talk about other macro indicators that affect crypto?\n\nA lot of people think global M2 is going to expand a lot from here. I say it tops within a few months and starts to drop as the DXY starts to rally. Remember, BTC always tops before M2. In fact last cycle, BTC bottomed shortly after M2 topped.\n\nUS interest rates remain above the 2 year yield, which I tend to approximate as the neutral rate. If that is true, then rates are still restrictive and it does not look like we have any immediate rate cuts.\n\nThe unemployment rate tends to rise into the summer, which we will likely have to start contending with soon.\n\nHires, job openings, and quits are all very low. \n\nSPX is near all time highs, making it difficult for the Fed to provide the liquidity needed to really move the crypto markets. \n\nYou say QT ended, but so what?\nIn 2019 QT ended and BTC still dropped for a while.\n\nIt's easy to pick a narrative about a single macro indicator and run with it, but the macro is very complicated.\n\nThe truth is these guys do not get to have a monopoly on using macro to justify their views.\n\nI can look at all the same data and can come to a different conclusion.\n\nComing to a different conclusion does not mean I do not take macro into account, which is a lie many of them try to sell.\n\nIf anyone of the guys running with the business cycle narrative had called the top in Q4, they would be preaching something completely different right now. They would then feel like they are allowed to interpret the macro in a bearish way. But because they did not, they have to keep the charade going by attacking anyone who disagrees with them.\n\nIt's gaslighting to say that anyone who thinks we are in a bear market is ignoring the macro.\n\nI would argue that anyone who called for alt season at any point over the last 4-5 years are in fact the ones who blatantly ignored the macro.\n\nEvery one is a genius in a bull market.",

But even if it does, it would most likely result in a macro lower high.\n\nI don't try and time those bounces. I have tried before with mixed levels of success. Sometimes it works, other times I got rekt.\n\nWhen BTC drops below the 50W moving average, it then goes to the 100W moving average, spends a little time there, then goes to the 200W moving average.\n\nEvery cycle is eventually the same.\n\nBTC topped when it always does (Q4 of the post-halving year), and so many have spent so many hours trying to convince you that it has not. \n\nAnd BTC entered into a bear market, and so many have tried to get you to believe that alt season is \"just around the corner\" because it always happens after BTC tops. What they fail to account for is social interest. After the 2019 top there was also no rotation into altcoins, which also occurred just before QT ended.\n\nI track the social interest in the asset class, and it has been trending down since 2021. There is no one new here for people to sell their altcoins to.\n\nAlt seasons historically occur *after* social interest has been trending up for a year, not after it has been trending down for 5 years.\n\nHave an actual plan on navigating this brutal asset class. Because if the altcoins you hold drop another 50%-80% from here, not a single influencer who promoted them will express an ounce of regret for it. And you will simply be living with the consequences.\n\nI get a lot of hate for saying the truth, but an inconvenient truth is better than a lie.",

Countertrend rallies can happen, but sometimes they happen when you least expect them, not when everyone expects them. \n\nIt makes sense to assume that a sweep of a prior low would offer some relief, as that has been true for BTC even during the bull market.\n\nBut in 2014/2018/2022 when BTC fell below the 100W SMA, it was straight to the 200W SMA before any relief occurred.\n\nThe time to sell BTC was late last year, not panicking on dumps in the midterm year. \n\nI just try and focus on the bigger picture and the bigger picture is that late Q3/early Q4 will be a better time to move real money back into the market.\n\nBetween now and then it is just people trying to make money during difficult times by trying to trade support/resistance levels.",
